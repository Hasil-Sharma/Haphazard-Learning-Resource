# Haphazard Learning Resources
List of learning resources which I found interesting. It covers machine learning, deep learning, distributed systems and other cool stuff.

### MOOCS
- [CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning][1]
- [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition][2]
- [Udacity: Introduction to Parallel Programming CUDA][7]

### Libraries
- [fastText][3]
- [Apache MxNet: A Scalable Deep Learning Framework][4]
- [tensor2tensor: A library for generalized sequence to sequence models][6]

### Datasets
- [NLP Datasets][5]
