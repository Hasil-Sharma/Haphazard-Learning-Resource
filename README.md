- [Stanford CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning][1]
- [Stanford CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition][2]
- [Udacity: Introduction to Parallel Programming CUDA][7]
- [Udacity: Advanced Operating System (Distributed Systems)][8]
- [University of Waterloo CS 436: Distributed Computer Systems][9]

### Libraries
- [fastText][3]
- [Apache MxNet: A Scalable Deep Learning Framework][4]
- [tensor2tensor: A library for generalized sequence to sequence models][6]

### Datasets
- [NLP Datasets][5]
